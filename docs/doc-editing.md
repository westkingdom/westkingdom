## How to Edit the Documentation
The West Kingdom infrastructure project uses open-source documentation
and issue-tracking tools, so that a diverse group of volunteers with
differing technical backgrounds can easily collaborate together.

These documentation pages were created using a tool called
[ReadTheDocs](http://docs.readthedocs.org/).  Comprehensive documentation
on how to create documentation projects exists in the [ReadTheDocs getting
started guide](https://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html); however,
it is not necessary to read everything presented there to edit these pages.
In fact, you shouldn't need to read any of it--although reviewing the
rules for the [markdown](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/) 
syntax used might be helpful.

### Editing Existing Pages
Members of the Westkingdom organization on GitHub can edit this documentation 
directly from the GitHub web interface for the 
[westkingdom/westkingdom](https://github.com/westkingdom/westkingdom) project.  
To edit a documentation page, visit the [docs](https://github.com/westkingdom/westkingdom/tree/master/docs) folder, and click on the:

- Click on the "edit" pencil icon.
- Edit the page using the Markdown editor.
- Type in a comment describing what you changed.
- Click the Commit button.

People who are not members of the Westkingdom organization can still fork the [westkingdom/westkingdom](https://github.com/westkingdom/westkingdom) project 
and submit a pull request.

### Adding a New Page
From the [docs](https://github.com/westkingdom/westkingdom/tree/master/docs) 
folder, add a new page by clicking on the control westkingdom / docs / [+]()
near the top of the page.  Then, edit the file [mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/westkingdom/westkingdom/blob/master/mkdocs.yml), and add the new page
to the appropriate place in the list of pages.

### Troubleshooting
If you make a documentation change, and it does not show up, you can
check the build status on the [West Kingdom Documentation Builds 
Page](https://readthedocs.org/builds/westkingdom/).

You need to be a West Kingdom ReadTheDocs admin to access this page.
Ask another admin to add you if you will be doing a lot of documentation
updates.
