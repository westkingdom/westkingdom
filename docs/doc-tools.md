The West Kingdom infrastructure project uses open-source documentation
and issue-tracking tools, so that a diverse group of volunteers with
differing technical backgrounds can easily collaborate together.

These documentation pages were created using a tool called
[ReadTheDocs](http://docs.readthedocs.org/).  Comprehensive documentation
on how to create documentation projects exists in the [ReadTheDocs getting
started guide](https://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html); however,
it is not necessary to read everything presented there to edit these pages.
In fact, you shouldn't need to read any of it--although reviewing the
rules for the [markdown](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/) 
syntax used might be helpful.

### How to Edit Existing Pages in this Documentation

### How to Add a Page to this Documentation

### Project Documentation
Most individual projects contain their own documentation in their GitHub project.  To submit changes to project documentation, you may fork the project in question and submit a pull request.  See the home page for each individual project for more information.

The exception is the West Kingdom website, which is documented with the rest of the infrastructure in the [westkingdom/westkingdom](https://github.com/westkingdom/westkingdom) project.  The West Kingdom website project documents only the deployment process.

### Feature Request and Bug Tracking
Feature requests and bugs related to the West Kingdom infrastructure as a whole are stored in the [westkingdom.github.io issue queue](https://github.com/westkingdom/westkingdom/issues).  Anyone may post new feature requests or issues here.
