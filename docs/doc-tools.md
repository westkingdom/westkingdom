The West Kingdom infrastructure project is documented in a few different places.

### ReadTheDocs
The primary West Kingdom Documentation Home Page was created using [ReadTheDocs](http://docs.readthedocs.org/).

Members of the Westkingdom organization on GitHub can edit this documentation directly from the GitHub web interface for the project [westkingdom/westkingdom](https://github.com/westkingdom/westkingdom) project.  To edit a documentation page:

- Click on the "edit" pencil icon.
- Edit the page using the Markdown editor.
- Type in a comment describing what you changed.
- Click the Commit button.

People who are not members of the Westkingdom organization can still fork the [westkingdom/westkingdom](https://github.com/westkingdom/westkingdom) project and submit a pull request.

### Project Documentation
Most individual projects contain their own documentation in their GitHub project.  To submit changes to project documentation, you may fork the project in question and submit a pull request.  See the home page for each individual project for more information.

The exception is the West Kingdom website, which is documented with the rest of the infrastructure in the [westkingdom/westkingdom](https://github.com/westkingdom/westkingdom) project.  The West Kingdom website project documents only the deployment process.

### Feature Request and Bug Tracking
Feature requests and bugs related to the West Kingdom infrastructure as a whole are stored in the [westkingdom.github.io issue queue](https://github.com/westkingdom/westkingdom/issues).  Anyone may post new feature requests or issues here.
