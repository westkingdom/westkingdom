This is the new documentation for the West Kingdom infrastructure projects.

The West Kingdom infrastructure consists of a number of different components:

- A [unified website system](website-overview.md), run on a single large web application.
- [Google Apps for Nonprofits](google-apps-services.md), powering email and other services.
- [Source code repositories](vcs.md), hosted on GitHub.
- [Documentation tools](doc-editing.md), such as ReadTheDocs and GitHub issue queues.
- [Legacy websites](legacy.md), still running on our older hosting provider.

The old design center is at https://wkweb.westkingdom.org.  Content from that site is being migrated here.
