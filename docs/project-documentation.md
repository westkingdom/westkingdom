## Project Documentation
Most individual projects contain their own documentation in their GitHub 
project.  To submit changes to project documentation, you may fork the project 
in question and submit a pull request.  See the home page for each individual 
project for more information.

The exception is the West Kingdom website, which is documented with the rest 
of the infrastructure in the [westkingdom/westkingdom](https://github.com/westkingdom/westkingdom) 
project.  The West Kingdom website project documents only the deployment process.
