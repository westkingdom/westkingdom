If you do not want to run tests locally, you may create a PR on the [West Kingdom Website](https://github.com/westkingdom/website) repository instead, and it will automatically be tested on CircleCI.

To test locally, you should be able to just run the script `./bin/local-test`.  This script presumes that you have a local installation of mysql with the default admin credentials ('root' with no password).
