The West Kingdom uses a unified website system that allows all of the
websites for all of the branch groups in the Kingdom to be managed
by a single unified system.  The benefit of using a unified system is
that the event calendar can be intelligently shared among all of the
sites, with each group's calendar displaying only those events which
are of interest to them.

The unified system is in the process of being rolled out, and has not
yet been adopted by all branch groups.
